## General Information
This app doesn't differ much than an average calculator, except that it's just made as mine version.
Moreover, I was curious about solving math problems with JavaScript and just to test myself in it.
Methods I used maybe aren't the best, but they are (mostly) working, so that counts for me.


## Technologies Used
- HTML 5
- CSS 3
- JavaScript ES6


## Features
#### List of the ready features:
- The application allows you to perform 6 mathematical operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation to any power and square root of any degree,
- You can clear the entire display content (AC) or a single character (DEL) or also by using a button on the keyboard (C – AC function, Backspace – DEL function),
- Supports storing values in memory and saving, loading and adding or subtracting from them,
- Stores a history of recently performed calculations,

#### Additional info:
- Supports conversion to a negative value,
- Allows to count percentages (4 actions),
- It is possible to enter numbers, operators: +, -, *, / and = with the keyboard,
- Includes 3 color versions and 2 languages to choose from,
- There are 2 hidden Easter Eggs.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_.


## Room for Improvement
Mostly, the project is done, but I'd maybe include some minor changes or corrections in the future.

Room for improvement:
- There are sometimes bugs within Memory section, however most of them are just related with JS decimal conversion and they occurs rather as typos than actual wrong values.

To do:
- Nothing more planned for now.
